The task project uses ```create-react-app``` to initialize the React.js ecosystem. So, it's so simple to get the project up and running, simply by installing the required NPM packages and then start the server:

```javascript
npm install
```

```javascript
npm start
```

## Used Technologies, Third-party Packages, and libraries
1. For the UI, `SASS/SCSS` along with `CSS Modules` are being used with native SASS/CSS, no UI frameworks were utilized.
2. Responsive design is handled using native `CSS Media Query`. Each component includes its own required Media Query handling.
3. Animations are also natively handled using `CSS Transitions`.
4. For the form and validations, `react-final-form` is utilized along with `react-select` for enhanced Select fields.
